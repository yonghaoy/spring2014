This should be my last post in INLS560. I have a great semester with you guys. Thanks Elliott,Grant and 
all the guys in class! 

I have been two meetups but one is 48 hours' big event, I think it will be counted as 2. Is that right?

It is a great event! 2 days meetup, ate there, slept there. After it, I alomost died.
I think it should be counted as 3 or more :)
That's my favourate meetups I have attended. I met a lot of  awesome programmer and some IT companies's HR.
What they did and told helps me a lot.

(2) https://plus.google.com/115820192701119569473/posts/CKinyPGSkWr Google Glass developer programmer Meetup.

I have explored google glass development for 2 months. And this meetups let me know my future step. Other programmers'
idea really open my eyes.


Overall: Meetup is a cool things which help me know more programmer, learn more knowledge.


Thank you guys, I have a lot of fun in the class.

Have a nice holiday!
